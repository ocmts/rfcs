# OCM RFCs

## What is an RFC?

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the framework.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Vue core team and the community.

## The RFC life-cycle

An RFC goes through the following stages:

* Pending: when the RFC is submitted as a PR.
* Active: when an RFC PR is merged and undergoing implementation.
* Landed: when an RFC's proposed changes are shipped in an actual release.
* Rejected: when an RFC PR is closed without being merged.
